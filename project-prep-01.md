# Project Prep 01

## Team Name - Team Meow

- Shelby Harner
- Audrey Patterson
- Lorenzo Ortega
- Mohsin Behi

## Conflict Plan

- We all agreed to have open, honest, and transparent communication
- When conflicts arise, we are going to approach it in a democratic way
  - if a vote is split and we need to escalate, then we can pull in Ryan or a TA to help split the vote

## Communication Plan

- We have a dedicated slack group for our team
- We've decided to be kind to ourselves and only reserve the free day on Sunday for really important or necessary meetings. We are going provide our emails though so that if there is a way we need to reach out to eachother we have that outside of our team slack.
- We are going to have a roundtable discussion everytime we meet so that everyone has a chance to be heard.
- Don't be a Karen! We are going to foster an environment of open communication and everyone should be safe to speak up.

## Work Plan

- Trello will be our project management tool that we'll be using
- We are going to have a group discussion about our strengths and weaknesses. This way we can make a plan on how each person will contribute individually and when we will want to do pair programming for other aspects.
- We will set up the HTML as a group and then do the other chunks as individuals
- We are going to have progress reports during our meetups

## Git Process

- All files for this project are going to live on GitHub
- One person will own the repository
  - other members will be collaborators
  - other members will need to pin the repo for easy access
- We are going to do small bit size pushes every night
- 2 people will be required to review PR
- Merges will happen at the end of the night and we will talk as a group before we do our merges -- no one goes off on their own!
- We will have a dev branch after the main branch and we will push things to the dev branch.
