        <p class="profile">My name is Audrey Patterson. I have been a software trainer/onboarding manager for the last 10 years. When my clients would tell me that certain aspects of the site or features were not intuitive, I’ve always said “If I knew how to make the changes, I would!”.  I'm excited to continue my journey into coding that will give me the ability to work on websites or applications that make life easier for the user.</p>

        <p class="profile">My name is Mohsin Behi. I have a background in data analytics and was most recently in a Business Intelligence and Reporting Manager role at Juul Labs. I joined Code Fellows to continue to pursue software development training to pivot into a backend software development role. I believe I can leverage my data analytics background in this specialization to quickly become an asset for any company.</p>
